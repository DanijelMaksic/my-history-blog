         <p>
            City of Kadesh, which was under Egyptian administration for over a
            century, fell to the Hittites. The city was located in strategic
            point between two empires, and was too far from Memphis and Hattusa
            to control it effectively. This meant that whoever ruled this city
            at the outskirts had more power. Ramesses II wasn't content with
            Hittite control of Kadesh, and just 3 years of rule passed when he
            started planning his conquest. In -1274 spies notified the pharaoh
            that Hittite king Muwatalli's army was deep into Hittite territory,
            which meant it was time to attack. Ramesses II raised the largest
            army Egypt has ever seen (20 000, divided into 4 divisions according
            to Egyptian sources). Egyptian army marched for two months until it
            came close to Kadesh. Hittite prisoners from Levant informed pharaoh
            that Hittite army was still far away from Kadesh, so he didn't waste
            any time and proceeded to the city itself. This information of
            Hittite positions was a farce, and Mursilli waited in the other side
            of Kadesh with an army of 48 000 men (mercenaries included). Hittite
            army was armed with 3 000 chariots, which included an archer and a
            shild bearer.
         </p>
         <p>
            When Egyptian army rested in front of the city, Hittite army
            attacked and cut off pharaoh's division from rest of his army, and
            would destroy it if not for the terrain which made Hittite chariots
            immobile. Ramesses II was forced to call the reinforcments, which
            were stationed by the sea. Reinforcements came from 2 sides
            simultaneously which confused Hittite army full of unruly
            mercenaries. Egyptian army was on professional level compared to
            their enemies. As the night came down, Hittites retreated and
            regrouped.
         </p>

         <p>
            At dawn, armies clashed again but were evenly matched now, and
            Muwatalli suggested peace to pharaoh. Remesses II denied the peace
            terms but pulled his army from Kadesh and marched back to Egyptian
            homeland, with prisoners of war and tales of valor. Battle was left
            with no real victor, Hittite army was outmatched by smaller Egyptian
            army but Kadesh still lay in Hittite hands.

         <h3 class="mt-8 text-4xl">Aftermath of the battle</h3>

         <p>
            This battle became a symbol of Egyptian dominion, even if it was a
            battle with no real victor (since Kadesh was left in the Hittite
            hands). Egypt was an empire which dominion was based on reputation,
            and if Egyptian army was as strong as Ramesses II tells in his
            reliefs, it would've taken Kadesh. This is not a first time in
            Egyptian history that stalemate gets called a victory. Ramesses II
            built more temples and monuments than any ruler before him, which
            cemented his importance, regardless of the fact that he couldn't
            take back Kadesh.
         </p>
         <p>
            Even worse for Ramesses II, Assyria was on the rise. Egypt started
            losing hold on Canaan, with many rebellions starting to lit up.
            Pharaoh read the situation and made peace with Hittite king
            Hattusili III, called Treaty of Kadesh. This treaty is one of the
            oldest completely surviving treaties in history, it fixed their
            mutual boundaries in southern Canaan, and was signed in -1258.
            Ramesses II didn't fully respect the treaty, as he didn't send a
            princess to Hittites for royal marriage. He loved women and had more
            than 100 kids, so it's no surprise no Egyptian princesses were not
            sent abroad.
         </p>
         <p>
            In Luxor, there is relief explaining the treaty, where Hittites are
            portrayed as begging the Egyptians for peace. At the same time, in
            Hittite capital Hattusa lays a relief of treaty with Egyptians
            begging the Hittites.
